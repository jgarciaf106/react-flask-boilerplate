[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/jgarciaf106/react-flask-boilerplate)

### Styles
You can update the `styles/index.scss` or create new `.scss` files inside `styles/` and import them into your current scss or js files depending on your needs.

### Components
Add more files into your `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them and import them into your current files as needed.
Use folder per components.

### Pages (Components)
Add more files into your `./src/js/pages` and import them in `./src/js/layout.tsx`.
Use folder per page.

### Context
This boilerplate comes with a centralized general Context API. The file `./src/js/store/flux.tsx` has a base structure for the store, we encourage you to change it and adapt it to your needs.

React Context [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

The `Provider` is already set. You can consume from any component using the useContext hook to get the `store` and `actions` from the Context.

```tsx
import { Context } from "../store/appContext";
const MyComponentSuper = () => {
  //here you use useContext to get store and actions
  const { store, actions } = useContext(Context);
  return <div>{/* you can use your actions or store inside the html */}</div>
}
```
## Features

- Extensive documentation [here](https://github.com/jgarciaf106/react-flask-boilerplate/tree/master/docs/assets).

### Back-End Manual Installation:

It is recomended to install the backend first, make sure you have Python 3.8, Pipenv and a database engine (Posgress recomended)

| Postgress	| postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/example 	|

4. Migrate the migrations: `$ pipenv run migrate` (skip if you have not made changes to the models on the `./src/api/models.py`)
